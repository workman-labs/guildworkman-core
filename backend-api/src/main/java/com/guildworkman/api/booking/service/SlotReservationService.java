/**
 * Public entry point for concurrency-safe appointment booking.
 *
 * <p>The booking flow is reserve → confirm:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #reserve} takes a short-lived, authoritative hold on the slot, so
 *       a visitor filling in booking details isn't racing anyone for it;</li>
 *   <li>{@link #confirm} turns that hold into an {@code Appointment};</li>
 *   <li>{@link #release} gives it back early, and {@link #expireLapsedHolds()}
 *       reclaims the ones nobody released.</li>
 * </ol>
 * The actual double-booking guard lives in {@link SlotReservationBooker} — see
 * that class for how the lock, the overlap check and the unique index compose.
 *
 * <p>{@link #reserve} is deliberately <b>not</b> {@code @Transactional}. It has
 * to be able to observe the row that won a unique-index race, and a
 * unique-violation marks the surrounding transaction rollback-only — so the
 * recovery read has to happen after that transaction has ended, not inside it.
 * Keeping the transaction boundary at {@link SlotReservationBooker#hold} rather
 * than nesting one (as {@code EscrowOrchestrationInserter} does with
 * {@code REQUIRES_NEW}) also means a booking never holds two pooled connections
 * at once, which matters here because the outer call already holds a row lock
 * for the duration.
